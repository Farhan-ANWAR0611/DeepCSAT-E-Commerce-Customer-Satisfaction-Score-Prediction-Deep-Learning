# 🛍️ Customer Satisfaction Prediction – E-Commerce Project

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction levels based on transactional and behavioral data from an e-commerce platform using machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate a multi-class classification model that accurately predicts customer satisfaction categories.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Google Colab** – development environment

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression (with class weighting)
- Random Forest Classifier (with class weighting)
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Implemented a full ML pipeline: preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Applied `class_weight='balanced'` to handle imbalanced classes.
- Final model (Random Forest) predicted multiple classes, improving performance over earlier versions.
- Visualized confusion matrix to interpret prediction results effectively.

## 📊 Insight
This project demonstrated a successful machine learning workflow for predicting customer satisfaction. Class weighting improved the fairness of predictions, and the final model provided reliable outputs across different satisfaction levels. Random Forest showed strong performance in capturing complex patterns in the data.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Apply SMOTE or oversampling techniques.
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Try advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.
